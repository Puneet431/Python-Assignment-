Calculate multiplication of two random float numbers
Note:
First random float number must be between 0.1 and 1
Second random float number must be between 9.5 and 99.5
num1 = random.random()
print("First Random float is ", num1)
num2 = random.uniform(9.5, 99.5)
print("Second Random float is ", num1)
num3 = num1 * num2
print("Multiplication is ", num3)
